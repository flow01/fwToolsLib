Houdini Tools / Scripts & HDA Collection

- Isolate Selection (alt-Q):

  this toggle will start a simple isolation-mode (as known from other packages like 3ds max, oder Softimage) only showing the currently selected object(s)

# INSTALL & USE

Windows:
for now you can simply clone this repo to a directory of your choice & update config/config.ini to match your environment...
(should be pretty self explanatory)
if you do that you can use "run_houdini.cmd" to start houdini and it will (hopefully) set all environment variables for you

you absolutely don't have to use the run_houdini.cmd batch file, but then you'll have to add the script & toolbar-path etc. to your environment yourself... more detailed instructions will follow as the library grows

Linux:
(still to come...)
